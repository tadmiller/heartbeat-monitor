# Final Project

This repository will contain the code for your final project - creating a fitness tracking device. It will be done in 4 parts, each of which will be added in due time.

## Using `git`

Remember to keep your repository history clean, with many small commits and descriptive commit messages. We want to be able to see the progression of your thoughts through the commit log, **not** just a single commit with all your code (and this will be reflected in your grade).

For the most part, the following commands will be all you need:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git status` (*always* use this before committing)
  - `git diff -stat`
  - `git push`
  - `git pull`
  - `git clone`

  You can learn about each of these using the internet, or `git help X` where `X` is the command portion of the above examples.
